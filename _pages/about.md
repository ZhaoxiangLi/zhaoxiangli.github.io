I am currently a Master's student in Urban and Regional Planning at Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Pengjun Zhao](https://urban.pkusz.edu.cn/info/1013/3181.htm). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Traffic Engineering from Tongji University in 2022. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Mobility & Travel Behavior**, **Emerging Mobility System**, **Energy & Environment**, and **Transportation Equity**. I will be pursuing a Ph.D. in Urban Studies and Planning at MIT, starting in Fall 2025, supervised by Prof. [Jinhua Zhao](https://dusp.mit.edu/people/jinhua-zhao).


Education
------
* **MSc** in Urban and Regional Planning, Peking University, 2025
* **BEng** in Traffic Engineering, Tongji University, 2022


Research Areas
------
* **Urban Mobility and Travel Behavior**: Leveraging transit data to understand the mobility patterns and behavioural dynamics of people and goods; exploring incentive mechanisms and intervention measures to promote more sustainable mobility.
* **Emerging Mobility Systems**: Assessing the environmental, economic, and social impacts of the application of CASE (Connected, Autonomous, Shared, Electric) technologies using causal inference and machine learning methods.
* **Green Transformations in Transportation**: Focused on technological innovation, governance, and strategic planning techniques to achieve green transformations in transportation systems.
* **Social and Spatial Justice**: In relation to accessibility to essential services, transportation infrastructure, climate and environmental impacts of transportation systems among different communities and groups.
