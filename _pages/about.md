I am currently a master's student in Urban and Regional Planning at Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Pengjun Zhao](https://urban.pkusz.edu.cn/info/1013/3181.htm). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Traffic Engineering from Tongji University in 2022.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Sustainable Mobility**, **Energy & Environment**, and **Transport Equity**.

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in a related field and expect to begin my studies in Fall 2025.


Educations
------
* **MSc**
  Urban and Regional Planning, Peking University, Beijing, China. 2022.09-2025.07(Expected)
* **BEng**
  Traffic Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China. 2018.09-2022.07


Research Area

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
