I am currently a master's student in Urban and Regional Planning at Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Pengjun Zhao](https://urban.pkusz.edu.cn/info/1013/3181.htm). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Traffic Engineering from Tongji University in 2022.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Sustainable Mobility**, **Energy & Environment**, and **Transport Equity**.

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in a related field and expect to begin my studies in Fall 2025.

Research Area
======
* **Urban Mobility and Travel Behavior**: Leveraging high-precision transportation data to understand the mobility patterns of people and goods in urban areas, while exploring incentive mechanisms and intervention measures to promote more sustainable mobility.
* **Green Transformations in Transportation**: Focused on technological innovation, governance, and strategic planning techniques to achieve efficient and low-carbon transformations in transportation systems, aimed at tackling climate and environmental challenges.
* **Urban and Transportation Planning**: Using causal inference methods to assess the relationship between urban planning strategies, such as land use patterns and urban forms, and sustainable transportation, thereby improving urban mobility, mitigating climate challenges, and optimizing transportation policy.
* **Social and Spatial Justice**: In relation to accessibility to essential services, climate change, and environmental impacts of transportation systems among different communities and groups.

Honors and Awards

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 


Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
