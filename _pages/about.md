I am currently a master's student in Urban and Regional Planning at Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Pengjun Zhao](https://urban.pkusz.edu.cn/info/1013/3181.htm). I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Traffic Engineering from Tongji University in 2022. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Sustainable Mobility**, **Energy & Environment**, and **Transport Equity**. I am now seeking a Ph.D. position in a related field and expect to begin my studies in Fall 2025.


Education
------
* **MSc** in Urban and Regional Planning, Peking University, China. 2022.09-2025.07(Expected)
* **BEng** in Traffic Engineering, Tongji University, China. 2018.09-2022.07


Research Area
------
* **Urban Mobility and Travel Behavior**: Leveraging high-precision transportation data to understand the mobility patterns of people and goods in urban areas, while exploring incentive mechanisms and intervention measures to promote more sustainable mobility.
* **Green Transformations in Transportation**: Focused on technological innovation, governance, and strategic planning techniques to achieve green transformations in transportation systems, aimed at tackling climate and environmental challenges.
* **Urban and Transportation Planning**: Using causal inference methods to assess the relationship between urban planning strategies, such as land use patterns and urban forms, and sustainable transportation.
* **Social and Spatial Justice**: In relation to accessibility to essential services, climate change, and environmental impacts of transportation systems among different communities and groups.
